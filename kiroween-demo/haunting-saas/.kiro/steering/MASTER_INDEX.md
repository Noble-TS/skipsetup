## QUICK START FOR KIRO AGENTS

### When Developing New Features:
1.  Start with `project-blueprint.md` for project-specific constraints.
2.  Consult `architecture-documentation.md` for system overview.
3.  Use appropriate agents based on the task (e.g., auth-expert for auth, payment-integrator for payments).
4.  Reference specifications for implementation details.

This context provides 100% understanding of the project for zero-error development.
